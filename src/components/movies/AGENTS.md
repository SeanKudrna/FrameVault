- `add-to-collection-form.tsx`: client form that lets a signed-in user choose one of their collections and invoke the shared `addMovieToCollectionAction` for the currently viewed movie. Emits toast feedback on success or failure and disables submission while pending.

If you add more movie detail UI, document new components here and note their dependencies (e.g., shared actions or providers).
