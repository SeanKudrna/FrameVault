# AI Agent Briefing â€” plans

## Overview
The `plans` directory archives product and implementation strategy documents used to guide FrameVault's multi-day build. These markdown files capture scope, priorities, and sequencing for releases.

## Contents
- `init/` holds detailed day-by-day plans (`plan-day-1-foundation.md`, etc.) and an overall outline.
- Additional top-level planning artifacts can be added here if future milestones need tracking.

## Usage Notes
- These documents inform feature intent and acceptance criteria; reference them when evaluating whether code changes align with the original vision.
- Keep plan documents updated if delivery scope shifts or new milestones are defined.

## Update Protocol
- When any plan file changes materially, update this `AGENTS.md` and the corresponding subfolder `AGENTS.md` to reflect new documents or focus areas.
- Note new milestones or retired documents so AI agents know which references remain authoritative.
