# AI Agent Briefing â€” plans/init

## Overview
This folder contains the foundational roadmap for FrameVault's initial multi-day build. Each markdown file details objectives, deliverables, and guardrails for a specific milestone.

## Key Files
- `framevault-outline.md` summarises the product vision, core features, and UX pillars.
- `plan-day-1-foundation.md` focuses on auth, Supabase schema, base UI, and the collections dashboard.
- `plan-day-2-experience-billing.md` outlines enhancements such as richer editing flows, plan gating, and billing preparation.
- `plan-day-3-pro-growth.md` targets polish, growth levers, and pro-tier capabilities.

## Usage Notes
- Treat these plans as authoritative context when prioritising tasks or interpreting requirements.
- Cross-reference plan items with implementation status in the codebase to ensure scope alignment.

## Update Protocol
- Whenever these documents change (new milestones, reprioritised work, etc.), update this `AGENTS.md` to describe the new structure and intent.
- If files are added/removed, adjust the "Key Files" section and notify upstream planners.
